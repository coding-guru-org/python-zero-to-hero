Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instances (object) of these classes. The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python:

- Numeric
- Sequence Type
- Boolean
- Set
- Dictionary
- Binary Types( memoryview, bytearray, bytes)
