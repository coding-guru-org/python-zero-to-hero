# Installing Python

If you want to learn to program with Python using this tutorial, you need to try out the code examples. You can use a website like [repl.it](https://replit.com/languages/python3), but I highly recommend installing Python. That way you don't need to open a web browser just to write code, and you can work without an Internet connection.

It doesn't matter which operating system you use because Python runs great on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux and many other operating systems. However, installing and launching Python are done differently on different operating systems, so just follow your operating system's instructions.

Let's get started!

## Windows

Installing Python on Windows is a lot like installing any other program. <br>
Step 1 : Go to the official Python website.[ðŸ”—](https://www.python.org/) <br>
Step 2 : Move your mouse over the blue Downloads button, but don't click it. Then click the button that downloads the latest version of Python. <br>
Step 3 : Run the installer.(Install as usual like any .exe windows applications). <br>
Step 4 : Make sure that the launcher gets installed. <br>

## Mac OS

## Linux

## Running Python on Windows 
( In this tutorial I am using Windows OS )
1. Open a PowerShell from your start menu or start screen. <br>
2. Type py and press Enter. You should see something like this:

3. Now you can type exit() and press Enter to get out of Python. Or you can just close the PowerShell or Terminal window. <br>

## Summary

Now you should have Python installed, and you should be able run it. <br>
