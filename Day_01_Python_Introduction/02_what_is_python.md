## What is Python?

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

- web development (server-side),
- software development,
- mathematics,
- system scripting.

## What can Python do?

- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

## Why Python?

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

## Good to know.

- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
- In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.

## Python Syntax compared to other programming languages.

- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
- Example: 
```
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Reason for increasing popularity

- Emphasis on code readability, shorter codes, ease of writing
- Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code in comparison to languages such as C++ or Java.
- Python supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.
- There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.
- Philosophy is “Simplicity is the best”.

## Language Features

- Interpreted
   - There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.
   - Directly run the program from the source code.
   - Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of       specific computer to run it.
   - No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.
  
 -Platform Independent
    - Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
    - Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.

 - Free and Open Source; Redistributable  
 - High-level Language
    - In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.
 
 - Simple
    - Closer to English language;Easy to Learn
    - More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax

- Embeddable
    - Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.


- Robust:
    - Exceptional handling features
    - Memory management techniques in built

- Rich Library Support
    
    - The Python Standard Library is very vast.
    - Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python ;It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.
    - Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries such as the Python Imaging Library which is an amazingly simple image manipulation library.


## Advantages : 

- Presence of third-party modules 
- Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics etc) 
- Open source and community development 
- Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write
- User-friendly data structures 
- High-level language 
- Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on the value assigned, it takes data type) 
- Object-oriented language 
- Portable and Interactive
- Ideal for prototypes – provide more functionality with less coding
- Highly Efficient(Python’s clean object-oriented design provides enhanced process control, and the language is equipped with excellent text processing and integration capabilities, as well as its own unit testing framework, which makes it more efficient.)
- (IoT)Internet of Things Opportunities
- Interpreted Language
- Portable across Operating systems 

## Applications : 

- GUI based desktop applications
- Graphic design, image processing applications, Games, and Scientific/ computational Applications
- Web frameworks and applications 
- Enterprise and Business applications 
- Operating Systems 
- Education
- Database Access
- Language Development 
- Prototyping 
- Software Development
